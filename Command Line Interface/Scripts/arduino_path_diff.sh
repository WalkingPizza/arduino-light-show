# This script prompts the user to briefly un- and then replug the Arduino. By monitoring a given
# device folder (/dev by default) it should therefore be possible to track, which device was added
# (which would then be assumed to be the Arduino). If a suitable device is detected, its path is
# printed to stdout.
#
# Arguments:
# <device folder path> optional
#
# Return status:
# 0: success
# 1: invalid number of command line arguments
# 2: the given device-folder does not exits, or can't be read
# 3: the user chose to quit the program
# 4: no fitting Arduino-device was found
# 5: multiple fitting Arduino-devices were found
